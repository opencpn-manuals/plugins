http://www.stripydog.com/kplex/[kplex];;
  Open source (GPLv3) software NMEA 0183 multiplexer for Linux, OS X and
  FreeBSD. Handles serial, pty, TCP/IPv4, TCP/IPv6, IPv4/IPv6 UDP multicast,
  IPv4 broadcast UDP and file inputs and outputs and performs optional sentence
  filtering, checksumming and data source prioritization/failover.

http://marinux.tuxfamily.org/#MUPLEX[MUPLEX];;
  Open source under GPL, a Linux soft multiplexer that can mix different input
  flows of real or emulate serial (USB, bluetooth) NMEA datas and share it
  between multiple applications, creating virtual serial port and TCP/IP local
  loop or network, as VSPE for windows.

  Closed source freeware, windows only, Virtual Serial Port Emulator enables
  you to use data from one serialport (such as GPS or NMEA data) simultaneously

  Tool for analyse NMEA textual data, allows to load NMEA log files and view
  data in table, graph and track forms.


http://marinux.tuxfamily.org/#OSD-DEPTH[OSD_Depth];;
  Open source under GPL, a Linux echo-sounder repeater which uses the OSD
  technique (On Screen Display, always on top of all applications, using big
  digits) to display the water depth from NMEA sentences 'DBT' or 'DPT' in
   meters, feet, or fathoms.

== VDRplayer Nmea Server for Testing

Contributed by Transmitter Dan, reported by R. Gleason

NOTE: This is based on Python2.7, a very old python version not recommended
for use. TODO: Update for python 3.

From the Command Line - Once everything is set up:

    > cd C:/python27
    > python VDRServer1.py Hakefjord-Sweden.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033
    > python VDRServer1.py Hartmut-Netherlands.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033

Another way to start the Nmea server is to define all the paths to the
various files so you don't have to change directory to C:\python\. This
example has the Nmea files under `C:\Data-Dart\Nmea\`

    > c:\python27\python c:\python27\VDRServer1.py C:\Data-Dart\Nmea\Hakefjord-Sweden.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033
    > c:\python27\python c:\python27\VDRServer1.py C:\Data-Dart\Nmea\Hartmut-Netherlands.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033

=== Download Attached Files

* Nmea-Server-Python-Script-README.txt
* VDRServer1.py
* Hakefjord.txt
* Hartmut-Netherlands.txt

These are available at https://github.com/transmitterdan/VDRplayer[]

https://tgp-architects.com/files/[Opencpn Beta File Thingie] (Please login
with username=rguser, password=rgpass)
Download from the Nmea-Server folder. PLEASE Remove “.TXT” from VDRServer1.py.TXT

=== Install and Setup:

1. Download and install Python27 Python is a platform independent scripting language interpreter.
2. You can Download Python for Windows here: https://www.python.org/downloads/ “Download Python 2.7.10
3. Execute the python-2-7-10.msi file and install to c:\python27 by default, it will require 95 mb.
4. Copy the file “VDRServer1.py” file into c:\python27
5. Copy the NMEA file Hakefjord-Sweden.txt into into c:\python27
6. Copy the NMEA file Harmut-Netherlands.txt into c:\python27
7. Open a command prompt Start > Run > enter CMD at the prompt type “CD C:\python27”
8. Then enter either command:

    > python VDRServer1.py Hakefjord-Sweden.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033
    > python VDRServer1.py Harmut-Netherlands.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033

9. Leave the command prompt window open to keep the Pyton Server program running.
10. In Opencpn, set up a communications channel for network UDP. This is what
    the setup screen in O looks like for Windows: In Opencpn
    _Options_ | _Connections_ | _Add connection_
    ```
    Connection Type: Network\\
    Protocol: UDP\\
    Address: 127.0.0.1\\
    Dataport: 2947\\
    Priority: 1\\
    Control Checksum checked\\
    Receive Input checked\\
    Output on this port not checked\\
    Input Filtering:  Sentences only button\\
    ```

11. Now you should see the Nmea data being run in Sweden or Netherlands
12. See TransmitterDan's Python script “VDRServer1.py”, which is also below.

=== Using Launcher_pi to make it easy

If you want to make this even easier, you can instll the Launcher_pi plugin
Then under _Options_ | _Plugins_ | _Launcher_,  enable the plugin.

image::nmea-server-launcher.png[]

Then use _Launcher_ | _Preferences_ to make appropriate entries to run various
nmea files for testing, eg:

    Name : Haken-Sweden
    Command: c:\python27\python c:\python27\VDRServer1.py C:\Data-Dart\Nmea\Hakefjord-Sweden.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033

    Name: Hartmut-Netherlands
    Command: c:\python27\python c:\python27\VDRServer1.py C:\Data-Dart\Nmea\Hartmut-Netherlands.txt 127.0.0.1 2947 .033

Under Options | Plugins hit Apply, Ok and then in the main Opencpn screen
bring up the Launcher menu.

You should see Hakefjord-Sweden and Hartmut-Netherlands to select. Try one of
x them. Don't close the command prompt or the nmea file will stop running. Now
go setup Opencpn > Options > Connections as in item #10 above.

OpenCPN Connections should have a NET Connection for:

    Type: Net Dataport: 127.0.0.1 2947 .033 Parameters: UDP Connection: In/out Filters: none


VDRServer1.py


```
import socket
import sys
import time

if len(sys.argv) < 4:
print(“USAGE:”)
print(”[python] VDRServer1.py InputFile IP_Address Port# [Sleep time]“)
print(“Sleep time is the delay in seconds between UDP messages sent.”)
print(“Sleep time defaults to 0.1 seconds”)
sys.exit()

UDP_IP = sys.argv[2]
UDP_PORT = int(sys.argv[3])
filename = sys.argv[1]

if len(sys.argv) > 4:
delay = float(sys.argv[4])
else:
delay = 0.1

print(['UDP target IP:', UDP_IP])
print(['UDP target port:', str(UDP_PORT)])

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, # Internet
socket.SOCK_DGRAM) # UDP
f = open(filename, 'r')

while True :
mess = f.readline()
if len(mess) < 1:
f.close()
sys.exit()
# print(mess)
mess = mess.strip()
sock.sendto(mess.encode(“utf-8”),(UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))
time.sleep(delay)
```
