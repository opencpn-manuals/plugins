= ODraw Plugin Messaging

== Messaging between Plugins

. Ocpn-Draw (OD) - OD Entities such as Point, Line, EBL, Guard Zones, Boundaries and Layers with ODraw Messaging used to enhance other plugins.
. Watchdog (WD) - Uses OD entities and messaging to create a large number of useful alarms.
. Weather Routing (WR) - Uses OD Boundaries to create Avoidance zones.
. Squiddio - Optionally uses OD Layers to avoid use of Navigation WP and POI. 

=== User Perspective

OD, WD, WR and Squiddio are separate plugins. In OD you can draw geo-referenced objects (lines, points, straight lined areas and circles). WD knows when and how to sound alarms. WR knows how to avoid boundaries. Squiddio has an option to use OD Layers which leaves the navigation layer cleaner.

In OD, a graphical indication (crosshatching or shading) may be added to areas, to indicate whether these are intended to avoid (crosshatched inside) or to stay within (crosshatched outside), or whatever other meaning you want to give to those graphical indications.

In WD you can select whether (certain types of) alarms should react only for areas that are flagged (in OD) as to avoid or to stay within, or for all areas. On top of that, in WD you can indicate whether this should be done only for areas labeled in OD as active, or inactive, or both.

The WD Boundary Alarm has 4 different types:

1. Alarm when approaching an area from outside (based on distance);
2. Alarm when approaching an area from outside (based on time);
3. Alarm to indicate whether your boat is inside or outside an area (Inclusion Alarm, another type of anchor alarm);
4. Alarm to indicate whether AIS objects are present in an area.

For the first two alarms the WD uses the same terms for the boundary that OD does as well as allowing a check for the state of the boundary. The third alarm only looks at a specific boundary which is identified by the boundaries GUID. The fourth alarm specifies a boundary to check if an AIS target is inside it.

Beside the 4 types of Boundary Alarms mentioned above, WD has the following alarm functionality:

1. Alarm when approaching coastlines (Landfall Alarm; 2 types: time and distance)
2. Alarm when NMEA-data stream stops (NMEA Alarm)
3. Deadman Alarm
4. Alarm when distance to reference position exceeds a set value (Anchor Alarm)
5. Alarm when course over ground deviates more than set (Course Alarm; 3 types: only port deviation, only starboard deviation or a general deviation);
6. Alarms when speed deviates more then set (Speed Alarm; two types: overspeed for more than set maximum, and underspeed for less than set minimum).

In total there are 14 different types of alarms.

*Technical aspects*

WD and OD are independent plugins. OD knows about drawing geo-referenced
objects, WD knows how to sound alarms. Now the two can work together by
passing and receiving messages, in this case JSON messages (basically a
text string of elements and values).

For the alarms, when WD needs boundary information, WD asks OD, via a
message, whether a Lat/Lon is inside a boundary. WD can add further
requirements asking for boundaries in a particular state and a particular
type. Both the state and type are the same as what OD use i.e.,
Active/Inactive and Exclusion/Inclusion/Neither, or the inclusive “Any”
(meaning any type and/or any state, not being as selective).

In OD the boundaries checked are both an OD Boundary and an OD Boundary
Point with range rings showing. Boundaries and Boundary Point Range Ring
are both considered boundaries. The type of boundary applies to both, but
the state (active/inactive) currently only applies to Boundaries, not
Boundary Points. This is because there is currently no state for a Boundary
Point. This may change in future updates to the plugins for consistency.

When OD completes its check of Lat/Lon inside boundaries it replies with a
single message containing the first boundary that the Lat/Lon is inside AND
which matches the type and state requested. The response message contains
the Name, Description, GUID, Type and State of the boundary found.

WD uses the returned message to decide whether to sound the alarm and uses
some of the information in the messages that are then displayed to the user,
i.e. a change in text in the watchdog window and a message box, if requested.

OD messages can be used by any plugin and OCPN itself to obtain information.
For the OD messaging there is a “structure” for the content of the message,
specifying the source requester, the type of message (Request/Response), the
message i.e. FindPointInAnyBoundary, the message id (may contain an
identifier for the source requester) and then the message contents, i.e.
Lat, Lon, Type, etc.

So a request looks like:

    Source: “WATCHDOG_PI”
    Type: “Request”
    Msg: “FindPointInAnyBoundary”
    MsgId: “distance”
    lat: 54.0001
    lon: -30.1001
    BoundaryType: “Exclusion”
    BoundaryState: “Active”

This message is then given a “destination”, in this case “OCPN_DRAW_PI”,
when the call to the OCPN messaging process is made.

The response will look like:

    Source: “OCPN_DRAW_PI”
    Type: “Response”
    Msg: “FindPointInAnyBoundary”
    MsgId: “distance”
    GUID: “62ec7520-b58f-4087-b077-ae1c581dfec1”
    lat: 54.0001
    lon: -30.1001
    Name: “Rocks”
    Description: “Good fishing”
    Found: false
    BoundaryObjectType: “Boundary”
    BoundaryType: “Exclusion”

Using this construct there are validation checks to make sure messages are
valid to process. If they are not valid there will be error messages entered
into the opencpn.log file with relevant information.

OD is not concerned where the message came from or why, it will just respond
to message requests with what is found from inspection of OD objects. WD just
wants to know if it should sound an alarm or not, so it sends message
requests to OD to determine certain conditions. WR just wants to know if the
current Lat/Lon is valid for further processing or not, so it sends message
requests to OD to determine certain conditions. AIS just provides
information on each target it is dealing with.

Now the check frequency in the WD alarm screen determines how often to check
for a Lat/Lon being in a boundary. One other item which should be mentioned,
is that for each boundary check based on time there are up to 11 Lat/Lon
messages sent to OD, for each distance check there are up to 163 Lat/Lon
messages to OD. Therefore the amount of this message traffic is something
to watch. Please note that a JSON message does not have a “structure” per
se, the message consists of element/value pairs written as delimited
strings. The elements can occur in any order. So “structure” in the sense
used in this document really refers to required elements.

WR Weather Routing simply uses ODraw boundaries for avoidance, and it uses the same messaging as above.
Squiddio simply has an option to use OD Layers instead of the OpenCPN Navigation Layer for WP and Marks.
