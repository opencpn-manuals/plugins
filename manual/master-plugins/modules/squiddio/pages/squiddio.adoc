=== The sQuiddio plugin

The sQuiddio plugin makes its global user-sourced and user-maintained
repository of sailing Points of Interest available as waypoints in
OpenCPN through a plugin. Typical POIs include:

* marinas
* anchorages
* yacht clubs
* docks
* fuel stations
* weather buoys
* …and many others

Click on each POI's icon on the chart to access basic information about
the POI, such as a marina's average user rating, address and phone
number. Obtain additional information, see photos and user reviews by
following the link to the POI page on sQuiddio.

Use the sQuidd.io plugin to plan your next cruise with the most
up-to-date user-sourced information available.

=== Getting started:

* In OpenCPN, go to the Options → Plugins and enable the sQuiddio plugin
(no settings are required).
* To view POIs in a _sector_*:
** Right-click on the area of the chart for which you want to view
available POIs.
** Select _sQuiddio: Download (Update) local Points of Interest_ from
the contextual menu (right click on the chart to launch the contextual
menu).
** For a touch device (e.g.Android), a right-click action is generated
by a so-called “long touch”. Touch and hold the screen point until a
context menu appears. Select the desired action. Note: Not all phones
generate an application context menu by touching the device “menu”
button. Depends on the Android version and device mfg. The general
method is “long touch” on the chart canvas. Should work on all devices.

* a _Sector_ is defined as an area of 5×5 degrees of lat/lon

Use of the plugin is free of charge. (http://squidd.io/users/new[Free registration] is required for certain functions).

=== Share your seafaring knowledge with others

=== Installing the plugin

* Look for the sQuidd.io icon image:marina_grn.png[image,width=20]in the _Plugins for
OpenCPN 3.3 and later_ section of the plugins
https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/info/downloadplugins.html[download page].
* Select the architecture and platform of your choice, download and
install the relevant installation package.
* After successful installation, the plug in should be available in the
Plugins tab of your OpenCpn Options dialog box.

=== Using the plugin

=== Viewing Points of Interest:

* In OpenCPN, go to the Options → Plugins and enable the sQuiddio plugin
(no settings are required).
* To view POIs in an area:
** Right-click on the area of the chart for which you want to view
available POIs.
** Select _sQuiddio: Download local Points of interest_ from the
contextual menu. (if you have previously downloaded POIs for this area,
the option will be named sQuiddio: Update local Points of interest
* To view additional information about the POI, and a link to the
sQuiddio POI page, right click on POI's waypoint, and select Properties.
** The waypoint dialog box includes a link to the Destination page on
sQuidd.io. If you have an Internet connection, click the link and your
browser should soon display the Destination's page on sQuidd.io.

http://squidd.io/places[squiddio places]

* You can hide all POIs for an area from the charts by right-clicking on
the chart and selecting _sQuiddio: Hide local Points of Interest_ from
the contextual menu. You can make the destinations visible again
(without downloading them anew) by selecting the _Show sQiddio
destinations_.
* You can also select the types of POI to show or hide: click on the
sQuiddio icon in the toolbar, then the _View_ tab, and select the types
of POIs you want to display on the chart

=== POIs as OpenCPN Waypoints or OCPN Draw Texpoints

In earlier versions of the plugin (< 0.7), POIs were represented on the
chart as OpenCPN Waypoints (which wasn't optimal, as Waypoints were not
intended to be used as static POIs). The introduction of the OCPN Draw
plugin has enabled POIs to be rendered alternatively as ODraw Text
Points, which has a number of advantages (e.g. view POI information upon
hovering the mouse, POIs cannot be mistakenly moved etc.) . If you have
the ODraw Plugin installed, we strongly recommend you select this option
by going to the settings dialog → _POI Rendering_ and selecting _ODraw
Textpoint_ as an option.

=== Submitting a new POI

sQuiddio relies on users like you to grow its database of POIs and keep
it relevant. To submit a new POI:

* Position your cursor on the new POI's exact location in the OpenCPN
chart
* Right-click and select _sQuiddio: Report a POI at this location_ from
the contextual menu. (Note: you must have a free user account to report
new POI. Signup https://squidd.io/signup[here])

=== Viewing NDBC Buoy and Ship reports

To view the updated reports:

* NDBC Buoys and Ships appear just like of any other POI on your charts.
Just make sure that the options _NDBC Buoy Report_ and/or _NDBC Ship
Report_ are checked in the _View_ tab of the plugin settings.
* Position your cursor on the Sector of the chart that you want to see
the Buoy or Ship reports for and select _sQuiddio: Download (Update)
local Points of interest_ from the contestual menu.
* To view the last 10 wind and wave reports for a buoy or ship,
double-click on the POI icon to open the _Waypoint (Text Point)
Properties_ dialog, then select the _Display Text_
* *Important*! these *POIs are not automatically updated* over time, so
you must select the _sQuiddio: Update local Points of interest item_ in
the context menu to download the most recent wind and wave reports.
* Note that https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/[NDBC coverage] is mostly limited
to United States waters, with some non-US (but currently few) other
locations. We are currently looking into adding other organizations with
similar services (e.g. Metoffice). Please contact _info at squidd dot
io_ for ideas and suggestions

=== Downloading Google Maps for one or more POIs

To download Google maps for a set of POIs:

* Zoom in/out in your viewport so that only the POI(s) for which you
want to download maps are shown
* Select _sQuiddio: Download Satellite Images for POIs_ from the
contextual menu. A separate map is downloaded for each POI and for each
level of zoom specified in the Download tab of the plugin settings. The
plugin follows the Google Maps zoom levels, the default values being 17
( ideal for, e.g., seeing the layout of a marina ) and 15, useful when
planning an approach to an anchorage or marina. You will be provided an
estimate of the size of the compressed file to be downloaded, and asked
to confirm the download.
* The Chart Database will be automatically updated when the download is
complete and the Google Maps will appear on your chart (Note: if you
have created a Chart Group for your Google Maps, you may have to close
out and relaunch OpenCPN in order for the maps to show)
* To change the zoom levels of the Google Maps to be downloaded, as well
as the directory where you want your maps saved (maps are saved as
raster files in the KAP format), click on the sQuiddio plugin icon in
the toolbar and go to the _Download_ tab
* You can also choose to download a Map to cover the entire viewport, in
addition to the individual POI-specific maps. See the option _Include
Viewport Map_ in the _Downloads_ tab

=== Follow your cruising friends on your OpenCPN Chart

If you are sailing with a group of other boats, chartering with a
flottilla, participating in a regatta or simply want to follow your
friends as they brave the unknown from the comfort of your home, you can
use sQuidd.io's Follow List feature to track the other boats' position,
speed and heading on OpenCPN (as well as on the sQuiddio web site). The
plug in will retrieve the latest log updates from your Follow List and
send your own GPS position at regular intervals. The plugin provides a
choice of various time intervals, from ten seconds to once a day.

Log sharing requires a free account on
https://squidd.io/signup[sQuidd.io]. To activate the feature:

. Create your Follow list on sQuidd.io
.. Log into sQuidd.io
.. Go to the Dashboard and click on the Update Follow List button in the
You are Following section
. In the Authentication tab of the sQuiddio plugin settings, enter your
sQuiddio ID (the email address you used to sign up) and your API key.
You can retrieve your API key online by:
.. Logging into sQuidd.io
.. Clicking on the Preferences link in the top bar of the sQuiddio web
site
.. Selecting the Numbers and Keys tab
. In the Log Sharing tab of your sQuiddio plugin settings, select the
intervals at which you want to receive and send log updates. Once the
credentials are entered correctly and at least one of the two time
intervals is set (and an Internet connection is available), the sharing
process starts and a progress bar will be shown with timestamps of the
last send/receive events (if you find that the status bar gets in the
way, you can minimize it by dragging it to the edges of the viewport).

=== FAQ About the Website

==== Are there Destination reviews, or just "star" ratings?

Most of the info on the destination page is user-editable by clicking on
the green “edit” link. The edit page has a Google map which can be used
to adjust the exact location of the destination, and three tabs, that
allow you to specify some basic info about the destination (phone
number, email address etc), write and intro paragraph, or add a number
of keyword-value pairs that provide additional information. All this
updates the Destination page once the edits are saved. User reviews are
entered in the form of user comments in the Media Feed, at the bottom of
the page.

==== Are there data fields for things like dockage or mooring rates, approach depths, VHF channel, available services, nearby facilities, fuel prices, etc?

Yes. That's what the above keyword-value pairs are for. With this
approach, you have an unlimited number of potential attributes to define
the destination. Just type anything you wish, e.g. “Toll Free Number” as
a keyword, then the enter the corresponding value. There is a type-ahead
filler in the keyword field that shows commonly used keywords (e.g.
Guest Berths for a Marina, or holding for an anchorage), but you can
enter what you want. Again, all these are shown on the Destination page

==== Also, what's with all the flikr photos and links?

Photos are one of the objects that can be posted to the Media Feed, in
addition to comments and reviews, since they are a great way to provide
a visual dimension to the destination page. Users can upload their
photos. In absence of user-supplied photos, we have pre-populated the
media feeds of many destinations with photos from the public domain or
services like Panoramio (discontinued) or Flickr based on lat/lon
coordinates. As users add their own, the new ones will replace the old
ones There is also a mechanism to provide photos and comments through
social media (see the link at the bottom)
