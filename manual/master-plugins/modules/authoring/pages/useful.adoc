Add [skip ci] [skip appveyor] at the top of the commit message. This does not stop circleci builds at present, although the build does not result in a beta or master package. It generates an alpha.

* *Finding broken links*

Under :build the site with antora" Full LInkcheck
I see a number of missing links.
There are a lot of links to cruiser's forum which still work.
I am trying to find the locations in the text for these.
How would one do that?

They are straight html link, right? Just do git grep :https://www.cruisersforum.com/, that gives you the matches and files. Or use git grep -l which just returns a list of files containing the link.

Rick@Dart MINGW64 ~/documents/github/development/modules/ROOT/pages (main)
$ grep :https://www.cruisersforum.com/
and cursor is just blinking.

This is using Windows Bash prompt.

grep reads by default from stdin... type control-C to get out this. Then use the correct command git grep which by default searches from current dir.
