== Local Build

This page shows how to set up the build:

https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/284

It involves creating an empty git repository in the folder where you are
using playbook.yml.

....
git init .
touch .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m 'initialize repository'
....

After this you need a structure like the following:

image::local.build.structure.png[structure]

The plugin folder has the same structure and files as the initial one
sent to the developer by PR.

It may be better to pull out the manual from the repo for working
somewhere other than in your repo.

No full github repository is needed. CD to the manual folder. Make an
empty repository in that folder as shown above.

Here is the structure as it applies to Watchdog.

....
├── manual
| └── .git
| └── playbook.yml (or bldloc.yml or whatever)
| └── ui-bundle.zip
| └── .gitignore
||└── watchdog
|||| ├── antora.yml
|||| └── modules
|||||| └── ROOT
|||||||| ├── images
|||||||| └── pages
|||||||||| └── watchdog.adoc
....

The watchdog folder is exactly as first sent via PR. `antora.yml' does
not need editing.

Get ui-bundle.zip from: https://github.com/opencpn-manuals/plugins or the
link below.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Rasbats/opencpn-plugins-manual/images/ui-bundle.zip[ui-bundle.zip]

playbook.yml has the following text:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/Rasbats/opencpn-plugins-manual/images/playbook.yml[playbook.yml]

CD to the manual folder, if not already there, and use: antora –fetch
playbook.yml –stacktrace

The output is in the public directory. An index html is created
automatically and the output appears as in the opencpn-plugins-manual.

The advantage of this structure is that the tool (playbook.yml) is
separated from the module (watchdog). Another tool allows making a pdf
of the watchdog plugin manual. TBC
