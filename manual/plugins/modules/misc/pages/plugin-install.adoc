= Plugin Installation, Update and Removal

This page is about OpenCPN plugins. A necessary prerequisite is that OpenCPN is
installed, this is not described here.

== Supported platforms

There is official support for the following platforms:
[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
| OS       | Platform | Version

| Windows  | x86_64 | Windows 7+

| MacOS    | x86_64 | 10.9+

| Debian   | amd64  | stable, oldstable

| Ubuntu   | amd64  | Supported LTS releases

| Flatpak  | x86_64, aarch64 | runtime 20.08

| Raspbian | armhf | 10

| Android  | android-armeabi-v7a |
| Android  |  android-arm64-v8a |
|===

Flatpak works on basically all Linux platforms and is the official support for
Linux besides Debian and Ubuntu LTS releases.

Note that there is no support for the various OS:es used on for example RPi 4
i. e., aarch64 platforms. Here, Flatpak is the only official packaging.

All plugins are not available on all platforms

== Managed and Legacy Plugins

There are two kind of plugins in OpenCPN: managed and legacy.

Managed plugins is the newer variant. These plugins are handled within
OpenCPN. The GUI allows installation, updates and uninstallation in  a simple
point-and-click interface.

Legacy plugins is the older method. Such plugins are installed like any other
program on a platform without using OpenCPN. Once installed, OpenCPN can use the
plugin after a restart.


== Managed Plugins

Managed plugins are handled in the _Options_ | _Plugins GUI_.

Available  plugins are listed in the catalog. This is updated when new plugin
versions are released, which happens quite often. The first step when using
managed plugins is to refresh the catalog

With an updated catalog here is a list of plugins:

[#managed_list]

In this list we can see all available plugins. The status is visible from
various icons:

[%autowidth]
|=============================================================================
|image:giftbox.png[] |  Plugin is available for installation, but yet not
                        installed
|image:system.png[]  |  A system plugin, always available, cannot be
                        uninstalled
|image:checked.png[] |  Plugin can be updated and uninstalled. If this is
                        not checked, plugin is a legacy plugin which must be
                        handled outside of OpenCPN.
|image:enabled.png[] |  Plugin is (is not) enabled, see below.
|=============================================================================


The installation or update is straight-forward. Click on a plugin, possibly
find out more by expanding info on it, or just install it. If the plugin is an
update to an existing plugin this is visible in the GUI.

== Plugin tarballs downloader

The built-in plugin system in OpenCPN downloads plugins in a special format called tarballs.  Such tarballs can also be downloaded without using OpenCPN with the plugin downloader available http://mumin.crabdance.com/opencpn-dl/[here].
Once downloaded, such tarballs can be transferred to a computer running OpenCPN and then imported using the Import button available in the Options | Plugins tab 

The downloader supports downloading the same plugins as those available in the OpenCPN program.

== Legacy plugins

=== Debian and Ubuntu

Using the command line first enable the opencpn PPA (if not already done):

    $ sudo apt install software-properties-common
    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:opencpn/opencpn
    $ sudo apt update

If the name of the plugin is not completely known, first search for it
using:

    $ apt search opencpn-plugin

This lists a long list of plugins. Select the one to install, using the
findit plugin as an example:

   $ sudo apt install opencpn-plugin-findit

Uninstallation and updates are done using the standard apt tools, see
the operating system documentation for more.

=== Flatpak

There is no support for Flatpak legacy plugins, here only the modern
managed plugins are used.

=== Windows

Windows packages are .exe files. These are available for download at
the https://opencpn.org/OpenCPN/info/downloadplugins.html[Download area]
The downloaded file is usually an executable ”.exe“ installation file.
Click on the file and follow the instructions, use the default alternative
on all questions.
Once the plugin is installed, restart OpenCPN and proceed to enabling the plugin.

*Uninstall and Remove*

This always requires Administrative permissions.

The recommended way is to navigate to
 _C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenCPN [Version Number]_ and execute the
_Uninstall-[Pluginname].exe_ in that directory.

As an alternative it is also possible to uninstall a plugin manually by:

* Navigate to
  _C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenCPN [Version Number]\plugins_ and simply delete
  appropriate [pluginname].dll file and [pluginname] subdirectory.
* Open the Opencpn.ini file in the
  _C:\ProgramData\opencpn_ directory with a text editor and search for
  “plugins”, to find these lines +
  `[Plugins]` - remove reference to the plugin. +
  `[PlugIns/[pluginname]_pi.dll] bEnabled=0` - Remove these lines.

* You will also find other lines with the plugin user settings, but these
  do no harm and could be left in place.

Common Paths used by Opencpn Plugin Packages

 - DLL and plugin subdirectory:
   _C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenCPN [version number]\plugins_
 - User Plugin Data:  _%programdata%\opencpn\plugins_ a. k. a.
   _C:\ProgramData\opencpn\plugins_.

=== MacOS

Although there do exist legacy MacOS plugin packages they are not documented
here. Recent MacOS has made these packages somewhat complicated to use, and
the managed plugins offers a better alternative.

== Plugin enable/disable

When a plugin is installed is is disabled. This applies to both legacy and managed plugins.
To enable it, check the checkbox in the _Options_ | _Plugins_ GUI, see
xref:#managed_list[above].
