= Building the plugins manual

This document describes the basic steps to build and publish the
manual. See the file WORKFLOWS in the main project  for other steps
such as initiating a new repo, editing  files etc.


== Publish to Github Pages

Push the current branch to the branch _build_, something like

    $ git push -f origin HEAD:build

Pushing to _build_ initiates a build job, progress can be followed at
https://github.com/opencpn-manuals/plugins/actions. The results
becomes available at https://github.com/opencpn-manuals/plugins
after about 2-3  minutes.


== Local builds

Local builds requires Nodejs and Antora installed. See
https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/install/install-antora/

With these tools in place, build using

    $ antora site.yml

The resulting website is placed in the directory _docs_. Check the
results by pointing the browser to the _docs/index.html_ file.


== Automated link tests

When the build is done at github, a quick check for broken links is done
using linkchecker. Logs from these tests are available at
https://github.com/opencpn-manuals/plugins/actions

If the commit subject contains the string [full-linkcheck] site is checked
using the checklink program from the w3c-linkchecks suite. This is a
very slow process (currently about 20 minutes) which however reveals more
errors, notably related to url fragments and corresponding anchors.
